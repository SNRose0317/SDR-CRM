## Current Status

### What Changed?
- âœ… Pivoted from "Dynamic Terminology" to RBAC approach
- âœ… Simplified from 5 phases (40 tasks) to 4 phases (20 tasks)
- âœ… Focus on permissions instead of pre-defined domains
- âœ… UI adapts based on logged-in user's role
- âœ… Completed Phase 1: Database Foundation (Jan 19, 2025)
- âœ… Completed Phase 2: Supabase Auth Integration (Jan 19, 2025)
- âœ… Completed Phase 3: API Updates (Jan 20, 2025)
- âœ… Completed Phase 4: UI Updates (Jan 20, 2025) - except Role Management UI
- âœ… System is now deployment-ready!

### Key Decisions
- Roles are just labels (not hardcoded enums)
- Permissions control access (not role names)
- Hierarchy provides team visibility
- APIs are data-centric (not user-centric)

## Risk Register

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Migration breaks existing roles | High | Parallel system during transition |
| Performance degradation | Medium | Caching and query optimization |
| Complex permission logic | Medium | Clear documentation and examples |
| UI confusion during transition | Low | Gradual rollout with feature flags |

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate (Deployment):** âœ… COMPLETE
   - [x] Deploy custom access token hook to Supabase
   - [x] Configure hook in Supabase dashboard  
   - [x] Run migrations and seed data
   - [x] Test with all user roles

2. **Testing Phase:**
   - [ ] Enable USE_SUPABASE_AUTH=true locally
   - [ ] Test API filtering with different roles
   - [ ] Verify UI adapts correctly
   - [ ] Performance testing

3. **Production Rollout:**
   - [ ] Deploy to staging environment
   - [ ] Gradual rollout with feature flags
   - [ ] Monitor for issues
   - [ ] Full production deployment

## Benefits Over Original Plan

| Aspect | Original (Terminology) | New (RBAC) |
|--------|----------------------|-------------|
| **Flexibility** | Limited to pre-defined domains | Unlimited roles |
| **Complexity** | 40 tasks over 5 weeks | 20 tasks over 4 weeks |
| **Code Changes** | Extensive refactoring | Mostly permission checks |
| **Business Fit** | Must choose healthcare/sales/etc | Works for any business |
| **Maintenance** | Code changes for new roles | UI configuration only |

---

## Notes

- RBAC approach based on industry standards (Salesforce, HubSpot)
- Focuses on permissions, not terminology
- UI naturally adapts based on logged-in user
- Much simpler than original domain-switching approach
