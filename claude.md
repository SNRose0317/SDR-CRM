# SDR-CRM Project Context

## Project Overview
HealthCRM SDR System - A customer relationship management system with complex roles (Marketing, SDR, Health Coaches, Medical Providers, etc.) being refactored to use Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) for flexibility.

## Current State (January 2025)
- Three overlapping person tables: `leads`, `contacts`, `persons`
- Hardcoded role enums: `['sdr', 'health_coach', 'admin', 'patient']`
- Complex permissions and data duplication issues
- Working features: SDR workflow, dialer, lead claiming, HHQ tracking, patient portal
- **RBAC Implementation COMPLETE** - All 4 phases implemented, committed to git, ready for Supabase deployment

## Active Refactoring Plans

### PIVOTED: From Dynamic Terminology to RBAC Approach
**Why:** User has multiple complex roles (Directors, Managers, various teams) that don't fit pre-defined domains. Need flexibility to create any role through UI.

### NEW: RBAC Implementation Plan
**Location:** `/docs/Refactor Plan/implementation_tasks.md`
**Status:** All Phases Complete - Ready for Deployment
**Key Features:**
- Replace hardcoded role enum with dynamic roles table
- Permission-based access control (not role names)
- Hierarchical roles with automatic team visibility
- UI adapts based on logged-in user's role
- APIs remain data-centric (not user-centric)

### Implementation Phases:
1. **Week 1:** Database Foundation - 6 tasks
2. **Week 2:** Permission Services - 4 tasks
3. **Week 3:** API Updates - 4 tasks
4. **Week 4:** UI Updates - 6 tasks

**Total:** 20 tasks (simplified from original 40)

## Recent Changes
- PIVOTED from dynamic terminology to RBAC approach after user feedback
- User needs flexibility for many roles: Marketing, SDR, Health Coaches, Directors, etc.
- Realized pre-defined domains (healthcare/sales) too limiting
- Adopted industry-standard RBAC pattern (like Salesforce, HubSpot)
- **Jan 19, 2025:** Completed Phase 1 - Database Foundation
  - Created migration files for roles, permissions, role_permissions tables
  - Updated users table to support roleId
  - Created user_permissions view for efficient lookups
  - Updated Drizzle schema with new RBAC tables
  - Created seed file for initial permissions
- **Jan 19, 2025:** Completed Phase 2 - Supabase Auth Integration
  - Configured Supabase Auth settings documentation
  - Created custom access token hook to add roles/permissions to JWT
  - Created auth helper functions and RLS policies using JWT claims
  - Set up Supabase client in frontend with permission helpers
  - Created AuthContext and PermissionGate components
  - Documented complete auth implementation with examples
- **Jan 20, 2025:** Prepared for Remaining Phases
  - Created comprehensive deployment guide
  - Created API migration guide for Phase 3
  - Created UI update examples for Phase 4
  - Created testing guide for RBAC with Supabase
- **Jan 20, 2025:** Completed Implementation of Phase 3 & 4
  - Installed @supabase/supabase-js dependency
  - Created Supabase server configuration
  - Created authentication middleware with JWT support
  - Created new storage-supabase.ts implementation
  - Migrated ALL routes to use Supabase client (leads, contacts, tasks, appointments)
  - Created parallel running system with USE_SUPABASE_AUTH flag
  - Updated sidebar navigation with PermissionGate
  - Created role-adaptive UI components
  - Created comprehensive deployment documentation
  - System is now deployment-ready

## Key Technical Decisions
- **Database:** Dynamic roles table instead of enum
- **Permissions:** Check permissions, not role names in code
- **Hierarchy:** Parent roles see team data automatically  
- **UI:** Displays based on logged-in user's role and permissions
- **API:** Data-centric endpoints (not user-centric)

## Next Steps (Deployment Phase)
1. âœ… RBAC implementation committed to git (commit d4b85b9)
2. ðŸ”„ Deploy custom access token hook to Supabase
3. ðŸ”„ Run migrations and seed data in SDR-CRM-RBAC project
4. ðŸ”„ Test RLS policies with different user roles  
5. ðŸ”„ Test parallel running with USE_SUPABASE_AUTH=true
6. ðŸ“‹ Create production deployment plan

## Architecture Notes
- Monorepo structure with Next.js frontend
- Supabase backend with PostgreSQL
- TypeScript throughout with Drizzle ORM
- Row-level security (RLS) for access control

## RBAC Configuration Example
```typescript
// Example role hierarchy
const roles = {
  'CEO': { permissions: ['*'] },
  'Director of Sales': { 
    parent: 'CEO',
    permissions: ['persons.*', 'reports.*']
  },
  'SDR Manager': {
    parent: 'Director of Sales', 
    permissions: ['persons.view_team', 'persons.edit_team']
  },
  'SDR': {
    parent: 'SDR Manager',
    permissions: ['persons.view_own', 'persons.edit_own']
  }
};

// UI displays based on logged-in user
if (user.role.name === 'SDR') {
  // Shows "Lead Management"
} else if (user.role.name === 'Health Coach') {
  // Shows "Patient Care"
}
```

## Testing Considerations
- All existing workflows must continue working
- Permission checks < 10ms
- Hierarchy traversal efficient
- Zero data loss during migration
- UI adapts correctly to user role
